I consider myself a fairly patient person. I really don't mind waiting for things. Although "good things come to those who wait" may be true in some occasions, the payoff is rarely worth the inconvenience. The only times I get truly frustrated waiting is when it is apparent I am waiting for something that really no wait is required for, or whatever service you are waiting for is organized so inefficiently that waiting seems to have been a design requirement. Another thing that is not particularly enjoyable is when something made to make things faster actually slows things down (hence the name of this site).

When I design systems, I strive to streamline the design enough to remove anything that isn't completely necessary to achieve the system's purpose. I'm sure most developers do, but scope creep, changing requirements, etc usually have strong effects on usability in the finished product.

I'm going to use this blog to post some gross violations of the KISS principle, as well as some thoughts on current tech trends, and perhaps document my upcoming cross country move.

Thanks for visiting.

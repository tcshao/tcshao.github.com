Dependency Inversion Principle
-----
This principle is probably the hardest to explain, but if you've followed along with my previous posts, hopefully it will be a little more clear to you than it was to me the first time I learned about it.  Here's a definition from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle).

>In object-oriented programming, the dependency inversion principle refers to a specific form of decoupling where 
>conventional dependency relationships established from high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules 
>are inverted (i.e. reversed) for the purpose of rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module
>implementation details. The principle states:
>
>A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
>
>B. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.

zZZZzzZZZZzzZZZz...huh? oh i'm sorry, I fell asleep there for a bit.

Let's go back in time to our original program, I will define these terms in context to our example to make it a bit more clear.

    static void Main()
    {
        var beginDate = DateTime.Now.Subtract(new TimeSpan(7,0,0,0));
        decimal total = 0;

        // get a total of the prices from the last 7 days
        while (beginDate < DateTime.Now)
        {
            var response = new HttpClient()
                .GetAsync("http://www.null.com/" + beginDate.ToShortDateString()).Result;

            int price = int.Parse(response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result);

            total += price;
            beginDate = beginDate.Add(new TimeSpan(1, 0, 0, 0));
        }

        // calculate the average from the total
        var average = total / 7;

        var emailMessage = new MailMessage("from@null.com", "to@null.com")
                               {
                                   Body = "The forcasted price is " + average.ToString()
                               };

        new SmtpClient("smtp.null.com").Send(emailMessage);

    }

Our main execution path here `void Main()` is completely dependent on our lower-level modules (`HttpClient` and `SmtpClient`).  The program is completely useless without the concrete implementation of those dependencies.  Therefore, `Main` is dependent on an `HttpClient` object and an `SmtpClient` object.  This means any behavioral change in the lower-level modules can directly effectthe processing of Main.  If a change is made to any of those lower-level modules, there is a risk it will adversely affect our program.

This is very typical of procedural code, as it's closest to how you would think you would tell someone to do something.  "Ok, make call to this web site, then take the data, perform calculations, then send it out." Being that we delegate so much in software, this becomes a risk when we are directly using implementations of other objects in our requests.  The motivating question behind the Dependency Inversion principle is "how can we switch that around?"

We achieved this inversion with our `PriceService` by doing two things:

* **Extracting the behavior of the price service to an interface.**
* **Ensuring that the Price service had all the information it needed to perform its task and nothing more.**

Through that, we made our software more extensibible:

* **We have a price service we can use in multiple applications.**
* **We easily have the ability to modify the behavior of the price service and not affect the application adversely.**

Now, the price service doesn't care who's calling it, and the high level module doesn't care about the implementation of the price service.  What they do depend on is the abstraction `IPriceService`.

In addition to better quality software, this can also help your team's workflow (Or keep you sane if you are a team of one).  You can create your interfaces and bust out a whole client app without even having a service yet.  This principle is sometimes called the "Hollywood Principle" (Don't call us, we'll call you).  As you're not using your main policy code to call other pieces of code, you're transfering a bit of control over to the dependent modules and having them do the calling.

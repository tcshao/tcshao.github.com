My name is Tony Castellano.<br><br>

As long as I can remember, I've had a keyboard in my hand. I've always had a passion for expanding my knowledge towards computers and software. I've been programming since learning to read. I have parlayed my curiosity and ingenuity I had as a child into a career as a successful software developer. I have spent the last 10+ years creating distributed systems.<br><br>

I am passionate about technology and advancement in software development in particular. Current trends I find interesting and will permeate the subject matter of my blog are Microsoft's embracing of OSS, the continued rise of JavaScript, PaaS technologies, and functional programming.<br><br>

With the rise of "NoSQL" databases, and multi-core CPUs, this is the most exciting time in development I have seen in years. There is more ways to approach problems than ever before (With of course the irony being, most of the patterns used are decades old now). I will be using this blog to experiment with new(er) technologies/practices and compare them with existing ones. My comfort zone is C# and Microsoft tools, but I will be using those minimally in the experiences I will share.<br><br>

I'm here to learn, and hopefully teach. I'm probably completely full of shit at times, feel free to call me out. In addition to that, I'm going to rediscover my passion for playing with technologies after years of RDBMS/Forms over data stagnation.<br><br><br>

I have no idea what i'm doing.<br><br><br>

Thanks for visiting!

I found K. Scott Allen's [post](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2013/05/15/where-is-net-headed.aspx) about the future of .NET crystalizes some of the thoughts I have had about .NET for a while now. As soon as Microsoft started open sourcing more and more of their development technologies (ASP.NET MVC being exceptionally notable) I started to wonder what the future would hold for .NET. Open sourcing definitely leads to better quality software, but to what end for Microsoft?  This being paired with the the things Microsoft is open sourcing are flavors of other things in the open source world.

It would seem almost to easy to have an opinion that would boil down to ".NET is dead, long live .NET" ds it's not going anywhere.  Although the framework itself is not open source, it seems to be up to the open source community to keep it vibrant, if at the very least "current."  

I don't think the framework is "dead", more than it's "done" ( as in "complete"). It's now possible to use dynamic, functional, and object-oriented languages with it.  With the addition of the work that came out from the mono project,  it's now possible to target all the current popular platforms with it. Still though, it's hard to see a future where C# climbs up the github language popularity ladder.

It probably won't, but really, what's wrong with that?  

I've heard complaints that it's leaving developers "out in the cold."  I don't agree.  The existing software isn't going anywhere.  As someone who, for some reason, finds himself having to open VB6 at least once a year to debug something, There will be plenty of .NET work for years to come.  It will just look a lot like the current work.

If that doesn't sound good to you, it is a great time to contribute to the open source projects that work to change that, or learn other languages/frameworks.

As long as I can remember, I've been surrounded by video games of some sort. Although I probably played more games than is deemed healthy for a child, As I've gotten older I appreciate how I used them as a learning exercise as well as something fun to do.

I look back especially on the sports games I played. I learned football, baseball, and hockey rules not by actually playing these sports, or by watching them on TV, but from playing their electronic counterparts. My mind was so conditioned to the trial-and-error nature of games, I basically tried to accomplish the goal of the game (score a goal, touchdown etc) and let the game decide what I could and couldn't do. The learning progressed like this for different sports: Move before the whistle, oh false start, guess I can't do that...Went across the line first..oh offsides. That continued until I realized all the "don't"s so i could continue on my way and do the "do"s and win. I figured out most major rules that way. Well,  everything except for icing in hockey, that probably took me another 10 years. I remember distinctly watching a Bears game with my dad and my mom was asking questions about what was happening. I answered her questions and my dad was giving me a look clearly asking "how did you know that?"

So what does this have to do with software design? It illustrates the point that you can have a piece of software "teach" a person how to do a task when the proper controls and guidance are in place.

Let's face it, nothing comes with a user manual anymore. The significant production cost savings are a major factor of that, but there are very few pieces of modern software where you load it up and are completely at a loss of what to do. Two major reasons for this are the evolution of "archetype" visual metaphors (ie, you see a magnifying glass on a program, its going to zoom, unless its next to an entry field, then it means "Search") and the de-cluttering of interfaces so only the minimum amount of decisions are asked for at a time (compare how many menu items appeared on say a Windows 95 era application vs something made now).

The more complex your data entry is, the more the need there is to break things down into the simplest components giving users the least amount of decisions to make as possible.  It is also important to create clear visual feedback when they do something that isn't allowed.  This way it will not only make their experience less frustrating but it will also promote understanding of the underlying processes.
